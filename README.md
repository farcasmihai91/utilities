## General utility functions and classes


This is more of a exercise in TDD and new ES6 feature more than anything else.
Great for learning but probably need adjustments for using in production. 
Also some of them are not so usefull and should be interpreted as exercise.

1. A stack implementation using ES6 Classes with unit tests.

>Very simple implementation of a stack in JavaScript with some additional helper methods.
Useful when trying to not repeat yourself with the same array functions over and over when 
you actually want a stak

`npm install`
`npm test`

Methods: 

* push - pushes a new element to the top of the stack.
* pop - removes the last element from the stack (LIFO).
* clear - clears the stack.
* size - returns the ammount of elements in the stack.
* peek - returns the last element.
* isEmpty - returns true if the stack is empty or false if it's not.
